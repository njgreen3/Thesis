@article{Lotfi2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a microgrid planning model for determining the optimal size and the generation mix of distributed energy resources (DERs), as well as the microgrid type, i.e., ac or dc. Considering the growing ratio of dc loads and DERs, dc microgrids could be potentially more beneficial than ac microgrids by avoiding the need to synchronize generators, reducing the use of converters, facilitating the connection of various types of DERs and loads to the microgrid common bus with simplified interfaces, and reducing losses associated with the ac-dc energy conversion. The microgrid type is selected based on economic considerations, where the planning objective includes the investment and operation costs of DERs, cost of energy purchase from the main grid, and the reliability cost. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model and investigate in detail the impact of variety of factors on planning results, including the ratio of critical loads, the ratio of dc loads, and the efficiency of inverters and converters.},

This paper proposes a time discrete approach, which allows one to calculate analytically the steady state DC currents at the firing points of each thyristor, if voltage harmonics or asymmetries disturb the ideal operation conditions. This forms the basis for an effective and accurate evaluation of AC/DC converter harmonics, especially for the investigation of parameter dependencies and for the application in harmonic distortion studies. Selected examples demonstrate particularly the analytical description of the discrete DC currents},

abstract = {Environmentally friendly technologies such as photovoltaics and fuel cells are DC sources. In the current power infrastructure, this necessitates converting the power supplied by these devices into AC for transmission and distribution which adds losses and complexity. The amount of DC loads in our buildings is ever-increasing with computers, monitors, and other electronics entering our workplaces and homes. This forces another conversion of the AC power to DC, adding further losses and complexity. This paper proposes the use of a DC distribution system. In this study, an equivalent AC and DC distribution system are compared in terms of efficiency.},

The current "DC-AC-DC" route from DG to DC loads via inverters may not be rational from the viewpoint of system simplicity and energy efficiency, a review on the current electrical distribution systems should be made. This paper reviews and evaluates possibilities of using DC electrical distribution systems with increasing RE resources and DC loads. There is potential of increasing energy efficiency and power quality. Drawbacks and merits are also identified.},

@article{Prodanovic2006,
abstract = {Inverters are a necessary interface for several forms of distributed generation (DG) and where they form a microgrid they have the potential to offer high power quality. The challenge is to coordinate the actions of a group of inverters so that they offer the level of power quality known to be possible from fast local control of a single inverter. The case examined here is a power park of several inverter-based DG in relatively close proximity. A basic requirement is that the inverters regulate the grid voltage and share the real and reactive power demands according to their ratings. In small girds with high proportions of nonlinear and unbalanced loads it is also important to actively control the waveform quality in terms of harmonics, transient disturbances, and balance. Further, it is important that these duties are shared equally between the units rather than having one master unit taking the lead in the voltage control function. A constraint faced in designing a sharing system is the limited bandwidth of signal communication even over distances of a few meters. A control method is proposed that separates the control tasks in the frequency domain. Power sharing and voltage regulation are controlled centrally and commands are distributed through a low-bandwidth communication link. Waveform quality functions are controlled in high bandwidth controllers distributed to each local inverter. Experimental tests on a grid of three 10-kVA inverters are used to show that the method fully exploits the inherent fast response of the inverters while also ensuring voltage balance even with extreme load imbalance. It is shown that circulating currents are avoided during steady state and transients},
