@article{Lotfi2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a microgrid planning model for determining the optimal size and the generation mix of distributed energy resources (DERs), as well as the microgrid type, i.e., ac or dc. Considering the growing ratio of dc loads and DERs, dc microgrids could be potentially more beneficial than ac microgrids by avoiding the need to synchronize generators, reducing the use of converters, facilitating the connection of various types of DERs and loads to the microgrid common bus with simplified interfaces, and reducing losses associated with the ac-dc energy conversion. The microgrid type is selected based on economic considerations, where the planning objective includes the investment and operation costs of DERs, cost of energy purchase from the main grid, and the reliability cost. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model and investigate in detail the impact of variety of factors on planning results, including the ratio of critical loads, the ratio of dc loads, and the efficiency of inverters and converters.},

@article{Grotzbach1997,
abstract = {By investigating AC/DC converter harmonics in more detail, the interaction of AC and DC side as well as nonideal conditions have to be considered. This paper proposes a time discrete approach, which allows one to calculate analytically the steady state DC currents at the firing points of each thyristor, if voltage harmonics or asymmetries disturb the ideal operation conditions. This forms the basis for an effective and accurate evaluation of AC/DC converter harmonics, especially for the investigation of parameter dependencies and for the application in harmonic distortion studies. Selected examples demonstrate particularly the analytical description of the discrete DC currents},
