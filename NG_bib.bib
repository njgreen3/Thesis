abstract = {This paper presents a microgrid planning model for determining the optimal size and the generation mix of distributed energy resources (DERs), as well as the microgrid type, i.e., ac or dc. Considering the growing ratio of dc loads and DERs, dc microgrids could be potentially more beneficial than ac microgrids by avoiding the need to synchronize generators, reducing the use of converters, facilitating the connection of various types of DERs and loads to the microgrid common bus with simplified interfaces, and reducing losses associated with the ac-dc energy conversion. The microgrid type is selected based on economic considerations, where the planning objective includes the investment and operation costs of DERs, cost of energy purchase from the main grid, and the reliability cost. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model and investigate in detail the impact of variety of factors on planning results, including the ratio of critical loads, the ratio of dc loads, and the efficiency of inverters and converters.},

@article{Prodanovic2006,
abstract = {Inverters are a necessary interface for several forms of distributed generation (DG) and where they form a microgrid they have the potential to offer high power quality. The challenge is to coordinate the actions of a group of inverters so that they offer the level of power quality known to be possible from fast local control of a single inverter. The case examined here is a power park of several inverter-based DG in relatively close proximity. A basic requirement is that the inverters regulate the grid voltage and share the real and reactive power demands according to their ratings. In small girds with high proportions of nonlinear and unbalanced loads it is also important to actively control the waveform quality in terms of harmonics, transient disturbances, and balance. Further, it is important that these duties are shared equally between the units rather than having one master unit taking the lead in the voltage control function. A constraint faced in designing a sharing system is the limited bandwidth of signal communication even over distances of a few meters. A control method is proposed that separates the control tasks in the frequency domain. Power sharing and voltage regulation are controlled centrally and commands are distributed through a low-bandwidth communication link. Waveform quality functions are controlled in high bandwidth controllers distributed to each local inverter. Experimental tests on a grid of three 10-kVA inverters are used to show that the method fully exploits the inherent fast response of the inverters while also ensuring voltage balance even with extreme load imbalance. It is shown that circulating currents are avoided during steady state and transients},

@article{YunWeiLi2009,
abstract = {In this paper, a power control strategy is proposed for a low-voltage microgrid, where the mainly resistive line impedance, the unequal impedance among distributed generation (DG) units, and the microgrid load locations make the conventional frequency and voltage droop method unpractical. The proposed power control strategy contains a virtual inductor at the interfacing inverter output and an accurate power control and sharing algorithm with consideration of both impedance voltage drop effect and DG local load effect. Specifically, the virtual inductance can effectively prevent the coupling between the real and reactive powers by introducing a predominantly inductive impedance even in a low-voltage network with resistive line impedances. On the other hand, based on the predominantly inductive impedance, the proposed accurate reactive power sharing algorithm functions by estimating the impedance voltage drops and significantly improves the reactive power control and sharing accuracy. Finally, considering the different locations of loads in a multibus microgrid, the reactive power control accuracy is further improved by employing an online estimated reactive power offset to compensate the effects of DG local load power demands. The proposed power control strategy has been tested in simulation and experimentally on a low-voltage microgrid prototype.},

abstract = {In this paper, a scheme of combination of voltage-controlled and current-controlled PWM inverters for parallel operation of a single-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is proposed. The voltage-controlled PWM inverter (VCPI) unit as a master is developed to keep a constant sinusoidal wave output voltage. The current-controlled PWM inverter (CCPI) units are operated as slave controlled to track the distributive current. The power distribution center (PDC) performs the function of distributing the output current of each active unit. In this proposed scheme of parallel operation, each of the units can be designed as nearly independent, and the CCPI units do not need a PLL circuit for synchronization. As a result, the parallel operation of UPS is easy to implement and to expand system capacity. For the purpose of illustration, the system, including three single-phase units which operate in parallel, is analyzed and experimental results are given.},

abstract = {The present work tries to condense the state‐of‐the‐art for the exploration and exploitation of geothermal energy. Although a lot of experiences from different sites worldwide are integrated in this study, some sections do reflect the German experience. For example, the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG, see page 78) enables also a specific promotion and growth of the geothermal sector in Germany by guaranteeing special feed‐in tariffs for a 20‐years period. During the last years, several countries worldwide have introduced similar renewable energy promotion policies (some of them restricted to certain energy sources only or requiring a certain renewable energy quote), supporting investigations also in geothermal applications. Thus, the experiences in Germany may be of some value. Dependent on the political‐economical framework, the geothermal exploration and exploitation of deeper reservoirs represents an excellent option to extend geothermal applications also in areas where shallow geothermal reservoirs may not be able to match the local energy demand. Therefore, also challenges related to the exploration and exploitation of deep low‐permeability reservoirs are included in this study.},

@article{Haselwimmer2013,
	abstract = {In undertaking heat loss studies of geothermal systems, it is important to consider the heat flux associated with the outflow of thermal waters at hot springs, which may account for over 50{\%} of the total natural surface heat loss. Conventional in-situ methods for quantifying hot spring heat flux may not always be feasible if there are low rates of flow or thermal waters are not confined to well-defined drainage channels. This paper describes the use of high spatial resolution airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery for quantifying the heat flux and corresponding outflow rate of hot springs using a case study of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. The approach is based upon the use of a simplified, steady-state, heat budget model that describes the heat gains and losses from areas of thermal water to calculate the hot spring heat flux required to maintain the temperature of these waters above ambient conditions. Inputs to the model include calibrated surface temperature maps for areas of thermal water derived from processing of airborne TIR imagery acquired using a broadband forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera as well various atmospheric variables relevant to the thermodynamics of water bodies. The model is applied on a per-pixel basis to provide maps of the hot spring heat flux for the thermal waters. The total hot spring heat flux, representing the sum of the per-pixel heat fluxes, is used to calculate a corresponding hot spring outflow rate assuming a fixed hot spring temperature. This approach has been applied to TIR imagery acquired during two surveys over Pilgrim Hot Springs in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. Although the heat budget model is particularly sensitive to wind speed, the results provide conservative estimates of the hot spring heat flux and outflow rates (at 81.3. °C) of {\~{}}. 4.7-6.7. MW thermal energy, and {\~{}}. 976-1400. l/min, respectively. These results are 2-3 times higher than field-based estimates of the hot spring heat flux derived using direct measurements of the flow rate in streams draining part of the thermal catchment at the site. This result is consistent with the synoptic capabilities of the airborne TIR data that map all areas of thermal water. This approach has significant potential as a rapid and repeatable method for quantitative investigations of spring-dominated geothermal systems in support of resource assessment, and long-term monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Induction generators are increasingly being used in nonconventional energy systems such as wind, micro/mini hydro, etc. The advantages of using an induction generator instead of a synchronous generator are well known. Some of them are reduced unit cost and size, ruggedness, brushless (in squirrel cage construction), absence of separate dc source, ease of maintenance, self-protection against severe overloads and short circuits, etc. In isolated systems, squirrel cage induction generators with capacitor excitation, known as self-excited induction generators (SEIGs), are very popular. This paper presents an exhaustive survey of the literature over the past 25 years discussing the process of self-excitation and voltage buildup, modeling, steady-state, and transient analysis, reactive power control methods, and parallel operation of SEIG.},

Several ORC units are already in operation but there is a continuous need of new and more versatile computer tools able to perform fluid selection and plant layout optimization. For these reasons, the present work is devoted to present a computer tool able to perform the fluid selection and the plant design of ORC units maximizing, for example, the net electric power for different heat sources' type and temperature (low, medium and high temperature). The optimum fluid is selected among 81 possible candidates. The optimization is performed taking into account a wide range of operating conditions: subcritical and transcritical cycles, regenerative and non-regenerative units and heat transfer made from the hot side and the power cycle (with and without the oil loop). Being the expander a crucial component, the axial and radial efficiency prediction charts are employed to estimate the expander isentropic efficiency. An exergy and economic analysis is also performed. For the selected test case the maximum net electric power can be reached using Toluene with a recuperative subcritical cycle.},

	abstract = {This article aims at finding the most suitable waste heat recovery technology for existing and future offshore facilities. The technologies considered in this work are the steam Rankine cycle, the air bottoming cycle and the organic Rankine cycle.A multi-objective optimization approach is employed to attain optimal designs for each bottoming unit by selecting specific functions tailored to the oil and gas sector, i.e. yearly CO2emissions, weight and economic revenue. The test case is the gas turbine-based power system serving an offshore platform in the North Sea.Results indicate that the organic Rankine cycle technology presents larger performances compared to steam Rankine cycle units, whereas the implementation of air bottoming cycle modules is not attractive from an economic and environmental perspective compared to the other two technologies.Despite the relatively high cost of the expander and of the primary heat exchanger, organic Rankine cycle turbogenerators appear thus to be the preferred solution to abate CO2emissions and pollutants on oil and gas facilities.As a practical consequence, this paper provides guidelines for the design of high-efficiency, cost-competitive and low-weight power systems for offshore installations.},

This kind of model is particularly useful when modeling 1D heat exchangers or piping, e.g., in thermodynamic cycles involving a phase change. Issues, such as chattering or stiff systems, can lead to low simulation speed, instabilities and simulation failures. In the particular case of two-phase flow models, they are usually linked to a discontinuity in the density derivative between the liquid and two-phase zones. In this work, several methods to tackle numerical problems are developed, described, implemented and compared. In addition, methods available in the literature are also implemented and compared to the proposed approaches. Results suggest that the robustness of the models can be significantly increased with these different methods, at the price of a small increase of the error in the mass and energy balances.},

@article{Nilsen2016,
	abstract = {Modeling geological carbon storage represents a new and substantial challenge for the subsurface geosciences. To increase understanding and make good engineering decisions, containment processes and large-scale storage operations must be simulated in a thousand-year perspective. Large differences in spatial and temporal scales make it prohibitively expensive to compute the fate of injected CO2 using traditional 3D simulators. Instead, accurate forecast can be computed using simplified models that are adapted to the specific setting of the bouyancy-driven migration of the light fluid phase. This paper presents a family of vertically integrated models for studying the combined large-scale and long-term effects of structural, residual, and solubility trapping of CO2. The models are based on an assumption of a sharp interface separating CO2 and brine and can provide a detailed inventory of the injected CO2 volumes over periods of thousands of years within reasonable computational time. To be compatible with simulation tools used in industry, the models are formulated in a black-oil framework. The models are implemented in MRST-co2lab, which is an open community software developed especially to study and optimize large-scale, long-term geological storage of CO2. The resulting simulators are fully implicit and handle input from standard geomodeling tools.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the influence of working fluids over the performance of heat driven ejector refrigeration systems performance by using a lumped parameter model. The model used has been selected after a comparison of different models with a set of experimental data available in the literature. The effect of generator, evaporator and condenser temperature over the entrainment ratio and the COP has been investigated for different working fluids in the typical operating conditions of low grade energy sources. The results show a growth in performance (the entrainment ratio and the COP) with a rise in the generator and evaporator temperature and a decrease in the condenser temperature. The working fluids have a great impact on the ejector performance and each refrigerant has its own range of operating conditions. R134a is found to be suitable for low generator temperature (70-100 °C), whereas the hydrocarbons R600 is suitable for medium generator temperatures (100-130 °C) and R601 for high generator temperatures (130-180 °C).},

In the wind energy conversion system (WECS) a synchronous generator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. As the voltage and frequency of generator output vary along the wind speed change, a DC-DC boosting chopper is utilized to maintain constant DC link voltage. The input DC current is regulated to follow the optimized current reference for maximum power point operation of turbine system. Line side PWM inverter supply currents into the utility line by regulating the DC link voltage. The active power is controlled by q-axis current whereas the reactive power can be controlled by d-axis current. The phase angle of utility voltage is detected using software PLL (phased locked loop) in d-q synchronous reference frame. Proposed scheme gives a low cost and high quality power conversion solution for variable speed WECS.},

The proposed system philosophy is totally flexible in that the developed control and management functions do not depend on the types, sizes, or numbers of the used energy conversion systems. The proposed system philosophy is also compatible with conventional grids. Therefore, the potential application areas of the proposed philosophy cover not only remote and rural electrification where stand-alone systems are required, but also distributed generation where interconnection to conventional grids is preferred.},
