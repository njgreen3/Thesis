\chapter{Energy Conversion}
\label{ch:conv}

Energy and power take many different forms, from the initial sources to the end results used. Necessarily, methods have been developed to convert the different forms of energy or power from one to another. The first method addressed in this chapter is the conversion process of thermal to mechanical to electrical energy found in heat engines and generators. This thesis is focused on geothermal heat, however heat engines can be used with a number of different sources including the burning of a fuel such as biomass or coal, or even as waste heat from an independent process. Next conversion between different forms of electrical power will be addressed.
