\chapter{Energy Conversion}
\label{ch:conv}

Energy and power take many different forms, from the initial sources and to the end results used. Necessarily, methods have been developed to convert the different forms of energy or power from one to another. The first method addressed in this chapter is the conversion of heat to mechanical energy to electrical energy found in heat engines and generators. Next conversion between different forms of electrical power will be addressed.
