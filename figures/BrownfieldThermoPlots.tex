	\caption{Thermodynamic plots from the simulated brownfield ORC prime power system plotting pressure against temperature (top), pressure against mass specific enthalpy (middle), and temperature against mass specific entropy (bottom). Source temperature and flow rate are assumed to be \SI{368}{\kelvin} (\SI{95}{\degreeCelsius}) and \SI{6}{\liter\per\second}. Sink temperature and flow rate are assumed to be \SI{278}{\kelvin} (\SI{5}{\degreeCelsius}) and \SI{7}{\liter\per\second}.}
