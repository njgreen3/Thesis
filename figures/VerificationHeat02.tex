	\caption{Comparison of evaporator and condenser heat flow rates for the validation of the ORC prime power system model with an increased evaporator area. All tests assume a sink temperature of \SI{283}{\kelvin} (\SI{10}{\degreeCelsius}). Tests 1 \& 2 use a heat source temperature of \SI{364}{\kelvin} (\SI{91}{\degreeCelsius}), while tests 3 \& 4 use \SI{353}{\kelvin} (\SI{79}{\degreeCelsius}). Tests 1 \& 3 use a source flow rate of \SI{19}{\liter\per\second} and a sink flow rate of \SI{13}{\liter\per\second}, where as test 3 \& 4 use a source and sink flow rate of \SI{8}{\liter\per\second}.
	%The power setpoints of the four tests are \SIlist{27.5;40.0;30.8;42.0}{\kilo\watt}. Tests 1 \& 3 use the maximum power setpoint while also ensuring the working fluid fully evaporates in the evaporator. Tests 2 \& 4, use the maximum power setpoint while maintaining a stable simulation.
