	\caption{Thermodynamic plots of the simulated greenfield ORC plotting pressure against temperature, pressure against enthalpy, and temperature against entropy. All points assume a source temperatures of \SI{91}{\degreeCelsius}, and source and sink flow rates of \SI{940}{\liter\per\minute}. Winter sink temperatures are assumed to be \SI{3.5}{\degreeCelsius} while summer source temperatures are \SI{8.5}{\degreeCelsius}. High flow rate points have a working fluid mass flow rate of approximately \SI{8.4}{\kilogram\per\second}}
