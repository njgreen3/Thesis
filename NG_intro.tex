\section{Problem Statement}
The state of Alaska currently has dozens of communities which are electrically isolated from the rest of the state. They effectively act as remote permanently islanded microgrids. These communities typically use diesel generators to provide most of their electrical power. Power sources such as coal or natural gas are less expensive in larger grids but these microgrids are too small to take advantage of such economies of scale. This makes it expensive to operate relative to the size of the communities. Furthermore, the remoteness of these communities significantly increases the cost to import fuel.

One method of reducing operating costs is to offset diesel fuel through the use of renewable energy resources. Unfortunately powering a microgrid with a significant portion of renewable resources can negatively impact grid stability. The goal of this thesis is to determine a method to incorporate renewable energy into microgrids without compromising stability and reliability. 

This will be accomplished through the simulation of several microgrid designs for a site containing geothermal hot springs and diesel generation. The geothermal-diesel hybrid power will feed into a DC bus then will be sent to loads via AC distribution. Alternative conversion topologies will be compared to determine an optimal solution for the chosen site based on cost and grid stability.

The area selected for the microgrid, Pilgrim Hot Springs, lies about 60 miles north of Nome in western Alaska. Since the 1970s there has been interest in developing the hot springs in order to generate electricity. Several exploratory wells have been drilled and indicate potential for low temperature geothermal electrical generation \cite{Holdmann2013}. The area is currently undeveloped\footnote{There are ruins of an old church and orphanage from the early 1900s, but those buildings are uninhabitable.}, therefore this remote microgrid will be designed from scratch.

\section{Microgrid Description}
Microgrids are electrical systems composed of sources and loads within a well defined electrical boundary. Energy storage is often incorporated into systems as well, but not necessarily. Many microgrids are connected to a larger grid but with the ability to become separated, or islanded, while still maintaining some or all of the loads. 

A microgrid can operate using Alternating Current (AC), Direct Current (DC), or a hybridization of the two. The choice to whether to use AC or DC depends on the demands of the loads, the available power sources and conversion devices, as well as the existing electrical infrastructure. The decision between AC and DC goes as far back as 1880s when George Westinghouse and Thomas Edison were competing to supply America with electrical power. Ultimately Westinghouse and AC came out on top in part due to the relative ease of transforming to high voltage and low current which transmits more efficiently. Furthermore, electric machinery that use AC to generate the necessary rotating magnetic fields operate more efficiently than machines which use DC power and commutators to rotate. More recently however, computers and other electronic devices which use DC have become much more prolific. This has lead to 

Approximately 70\% of the population of Alaska is connected to a single grid called the Railbelt \cite{railbelt}. The Railbelt stretches over 600 miles from the Homer on the Kenai Peninsula to the greater Fairbanks area in the interior and includes most communities on the road system in between. The remaining communities and villages are effectively permanently islanded microgrids. 

\subsection{Sources}
Microgrid power is typically generated by Distributed Energy Resources (DER). This can include renewable resources such as solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, and geothermal as well as and non-renewable sources such diesel generators and natural gas micro-turbines. 
%Most power sources generate AC power. Current is induced by rotating coils withing a magnetic field

Diesel generators use the combustion of diesel fuel to spin an alternator producing AC power. These generators are prolific in rural Alaska generally being used as the prime mover to regulate grid frequency and voltage. 
%These generators are composed of an engine, alternator, fuel system, excitation system, governor, cooling system, exhaust system, and turbocharger.
Due to their widespread use, significant energy cost savings can be generated by reducing fuel consumption through efficiency improvements and use of alternate energy sources.

Geothermal generators are heat engines and can operate similarly to traditional coal and nuclear plants. Heat causes a working fluid to thermally expand and change phases thus spinning a turbine to produce AC power. The primary difference is that geothermal systems get heat from the Earth as opposed to combustion or nuclear reactions. Geothermal generators can be divided into high heat and low heat categories. High heat geothermal systems work with temperatures at and above the boiling point of water which means water can be used as the working fluid. Low heat systems operate at temperatures below the boiling point of water therefore must use a refrigerant as an alternative working fluid. 

Wind turbine generators produce what is known as wild AC, where frequency and voltage are unregulated and can vary with wind speed. Modern wind turbines have built-in methods of ensuring

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels generate DC power. Panels are made up of a string of cells of a semiconductor material. The most commonly used material is Silicon, but Gallium Arsenide (GaAr), Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), and Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) can be used in certain applications as well. Regardless of the material, all PV panels operate by absorbing sunlight and exciting electrons to higher energy orbital. Some fraction of the excited electrons become free and capable of generating a current. PV systems in Alaska face certain challenges due to the long dark winters, however there are also several beneficial characteristics. Solar PV cell operate more efficiently in colder temperatures and reflection due to high albedo of snow can increase the light incident on appropriately positioned panels. During the months of March and April, twelve or more hours of sunlight are available, but temperatures remain relatively cool and the ground remains covered in snow. For those reasons solar PV can be especially competitive in the Alaskan spring.

\subsection{Storage}
Energy storage is beneficial to microgrid operation because it allows generation to be spread over time. Such devices can include batteries, flywheels, super-capacitors, pumped hydro, and more. These devices have different storage duration and discharge times making different storage technologies advantageous in different situations \cite{Schoenung2003}. The discharge of bulk energy storage over the course of many hours allows for load leveling and provides spinning reserve\footnote{Spinning reserve is extra operating capacity capable of responding to sudden load increases at will.} for the grid. Load peak shaving typically involves a discharge time from minutes to several hours. Energy storage discharge over seconds and sub-seconds is generally done to improve power quality.

\subsection{Loads}
Well designed microgrids are designed around expected loads. Loads can require active as well as reactive power. Active power, also called real power, is capable of doing work and is associated with resistive loads. Reactive power does no net work but is generally consumed maintainin magnetic or electric fields in inductive loads. Capacitive loads generate reactive power rather than consume it.

\subsection{Control}
A microgrid control system ties all the other components together. Control systems monitor maintain voltage and frequency of the grid while ensuring sufficient active and reactive power is supplied to the loads.

\subsection{Conversion}
Conversion devices take a form of electrical power (AC or DC) and convert it into a different form. Inverters convert DC power into sinusoidal AC power. Rectifiers convert AC to DC. DC-DC converters can step up or down the voltage level of a DC power source. Transformers can step up or down the voltage level of an AC source while maintaining frequency. Modifying the frequency of an AC source typically involves rectifying the source then inverting then that output at the desired frequency.
